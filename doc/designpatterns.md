Read through some designs at OO Design's catalog of patterns and find one that fits someplace in your project. You are probably alreday using one without knowing it. Write a document in /doc/designpatterns.md that describes which design patterns you can find or fit in your setting. Itâ€™s valid that you may not be able to find any that you already use, but very unlikely that you cannot find an improvement to your design that incorporates one or more of the patterns. This document should be written in english with complete sentences and include:

an introduction with a description of the patterns you use currently,

a section that details a list of the patterns which may fit well into your design,

and a plan of how intend to continue designing modules.
