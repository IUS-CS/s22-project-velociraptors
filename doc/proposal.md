Challenge Accepted! - Project Proposal


**Overview**

Challenge Accepted is a Discord bot with a scoreboard to keep track of who in the server is right/wrong most often.


**Vision Statment**

• FOR people that want to settle debates

• WHO want to keep a running scoreboard,

• Challenge Accepted is a Discord bot

• THAT lets you remind your friends how often you're right.

• UNLIKE other Discord bots

• OUR PRODUCT keeps track of who is right and who is wrong over time.

**Use case**

An ideal scenario for our application would be when a user spots a message in a Discord text channel that they want to challenge. They can challenge the user, and others in the channel can vote on the winner of the challenge. The winner's score is updated, and then they can share the running scoreboard with their friends for bragging rights/to shame their inferior friends.
