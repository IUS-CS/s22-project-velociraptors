Velociraptors Semester Project Proposal

**Overview**
Our program is a web-based application that serves as a browser for users to look up information
as well as a scoreboard to keep track of who in the users' group of friends is right/wrong most often.

**Use case**
An ideal scenario for our application would be when a user is hanging out with friends who have a disagreement over a subject, and they turn to the internet to solve it. They would pull up our app in place of a web search so that they can keep track of who is right/wrong once they find the answer. Then they can share the running scoreboard with their friends for bragging rights/to shame their inferior friends.
