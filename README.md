## What is it?
Challenge Accepted is a web-based application that serves as a browser for users to look up information as well as a scoreboard to keep track of who in the users' group of friends is right/wrong most often.

## How does it work? 
You open the web page and select the two names of the people who are arguing. 

You will then be prompted to select who started the argument. 

After searching the web you come back and select who was right. 

The app will keep track of everybody's score and will show a leaderboard at the end.
